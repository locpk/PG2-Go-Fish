Five cards are dealt from a standard 52-card deck to each player, 
or seven cards if there are four or fewer players. 
The remaining cards are shared between the players, 
usually spread out in a disorderly pile referred to as the "ocean" or "pool".
The player whose turn it is to play asks another player for his or her cards of a particular rank. 
For example Alice may ask, "Bob, do you have any threes?"
 Alice must have at least one card of the rank she requested. 
Bob must hand over all cards of that rank if possible. 
If he has none, Alice is told to "go fish," 
and she draws a card from the pool and places it in her own hand. 
Then it is the next player's turn – unless it is the card being asked for, 
in which case it is shown to the other players, and she gets another turn. 
When any player at any time has all four cards of one rank, 
it forms a book, and the cards must be placed face up in front of that player.
Play proceeds to the left. When all sets of cards have been laid down,
 the game ends. 
 The player with the most piles wins.
